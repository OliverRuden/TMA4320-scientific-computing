# TMA4320-scientific-computing
by Oliver Ruden, Astrid Mysterud and Åsmund Mjøs

A repository containing our scientific computing project for:

Biophysics:
Here, we simulated the behaviour of a polymer with montecarlo simulation

Industrial mathematics:
Here, we used machinelearning to do basic addition and sorting

Technical physics:
Here we simulated plastic moving in the ocean using weather data. 

Merged from separate repositories, hence commit-history is lost.
