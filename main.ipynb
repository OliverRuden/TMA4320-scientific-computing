    "As task $1.1$ asks, we start by showing an example of how training a transformer model would look like to predict an integer $d$, given the two digit integers $a$ and $c$, and the one digit integer $b$. $d$ will be given by $d=a\\cdot b+c$. Let $a=31$, $b=7$ and $c=1$. This gives $d=31\\cdot 7+1=218$. The arrays $x$ and $y$ then become\n",

As output, we get a prediction $\\hat{z}^{(0)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^5$. The last digit, $z_4^{(0)}$, of this sequence will be added to the input-sequence, which will be sent into $f_\\theta$ again. Then, a new prediction $\\hat{z}^{(1)}$ is made, and the last element $z_5^{(1)}$ will be added to the input-sequence. This process continues until we get the final prediction $\\hat{y}=[\\hat{z}_4^{(0)}, \\hat{z}_5^{(1)}, \\hat{z}_6^{(2)}]$ which will be compared to the array $y=[2,1,8]$, to check whether the model works.
